# 概要
従業員、管理者(マネージャー)に向けた出勤、退勤の記録による労働時間の記録と給与の計算を行う勤怠管理アプリの作成を行った。

------

# 開発の目的
現代の社会では、デジタル化が進み紙媒体で物事の記録を行うということはなくなってきた。しかし、個人事業主などはシステムの導入にコストがかかりなかなか手が出ないこともある。そこで今回私は手軽に作れて費用も安く抑えられるようなアプリを作成した。

----

# このアプリの拡張性
・オンラインで従業員の勤務状況の把握(可視化)

# 今後挑戦したいこと
・javaで同じような勤怠管理アプリを作成すること



## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
